# Changelog

## 2.6.0

- Comments at the top of the file now become the section description text.
  By @phaer in https://github.com/nix-community/nixdoc/pull/70

  For example, the following file
  ```nix
  /*
  This is just a test!
  */
  {
    /* Increments a number by one */
    increment = x: x + 1;
  }
  ```

  turns into the following markdown:

  ```markdown
  # Test {#sec-functions-library-test}
  This is just a test!

  ## `lib.test.increment` {#function-library-lib.test.increment}

  Increments a number by one

  `x`

  : Function argument
  ```
